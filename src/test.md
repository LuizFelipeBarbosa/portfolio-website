**Title: "The Knot"**  

The room was a cathedral of shadows, its walls lined with velvet drapes that pooled like liquid night. A single chandelier cast jagged light across the floor, where Miguel lay bound to the bedframe, his wrists and ankles secured with thick leather cuffs. His body was a map of tension, his breaths shallow, his eyes locked on Morgan as she approached. She wore a black leather corset, its straps tight across her chest, and the strap-on—smooth, cold, and unyielding—pressed against her pubic bone like a promise.  

Morgan knelt, her fingers brushing the curve of his thigh, her voice a whisper. “You remember the first time, don’t you?” She tilted his chin up, her lips grazing his ear. “You begged me to tie you. You said you’d never be free without me.”  

Miguel’s throat tightened. The memory surfaced: the night they’d met, his hands trembling as he tied her wrists to the bed, her laughter ringing in his ears. He’d been a stranger then, a man desperate to feel *something*, anything. Now, the roles had reversed.  

She adjusted the strap-on, the rubber sliding against her skin as she positioned herself. “You’re mine,” she murmured, her voice a 
command. “Always.”  

With a slow, deliberate motion, she pressed into him, the strap-on’s weight a crushing, intoxicating force. The pain was sharp, but it was *hers*. She moved, her hips rolling in a rhythm that made his body tremble. Each thrust was a sentence, each moan a confession. The restraints bit into his wrists, the leather cuffs digging into his ankles, but he didn’t fight. He *wanted* this.  

Morgan’s hands gripped his shoulders, her nails digging into his skin as she increased the pace. “You’re mine,” she growled, her voice rising. “You’re *mine*.” The strap-on’s friction burned, a mix of pain and pleasure that coiled around him like a serpent. His legs trembled, his body arching as he reached for her, his fingers brushing the curve of her hip.  

“More,” he gasped, his voice cracking. “I need more.”  

She leaned in, her lips brushing his neck. “You’ll never escape me,” she whispered. “You’ll always be mine.”  

The climax hit like a storm. Morgan’s body locked, her hips thrusting with a ferocity that made him shudder. The strap-on’s weight 
pressed against him, the restraints tightening, the pain and pleasure merging into a single, overwhelming sensation. Miguel’s moans 
rose, raw and desperate, as he surrendered to her control.  

When it was over, Morgan released him, her hands trailing down his chest as she unbound his wrists. He lay still, his breaths shallow, his body trembling. She knelt beside him, her fingers brushing his lips. “You’re mine,” she said, her voice soft now. “Forever.”  

Miguel smiled, his eyes locked on hers. “Always.”  

The room fell silent, the shadows deepening as their bodies rested, bound by more than just chains. The strap-on was removed, the 
restraints loosened, but the connection between them remained—a bond forged in pain, pleasure, and the unbreakable promise of *always*.
