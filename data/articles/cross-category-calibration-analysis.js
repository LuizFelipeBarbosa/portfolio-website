        "Prediction markets promise a simple bargain: prices should equal probabilities (Wolfers & Zitzewitz, 2006). A contract trading at 70 cents should resolve in the affirmative 70% of the time. When they don't, the gap between price and reality represents either a trading opportunity or a structural feature of how these markets operate.",
        "Recent work by Bürgi, Deng, and Whelan (2025) provides the first systematic analysis of Kalshi's pricing across all contract types, documenting a favorite–longshot bias at the exchange level. This article extends that line of inquiry by decomposing calibration accuracy within a single contract family — mention markets — across categories, time horizons, and trading strategies.",
        "This article examines calibration accuracy across Kalshi's mention markets -- binary prediction contracts that resolve based on whether a specific person, topic, or phrase is mentioned during a scheduled broadcast or event. The analysis covers 18,948 resolved contracts across 126 distinct series, spanning six categories: Politicians, Sports, Earnings, Entertainment, Finance, and Media/News. Using volume-weighted average prices (VWAPs) computed at multiple time horizons before each market's final trade, we measure how well prices track actual outcomes, how quickly markets converge toward fair pricing, and whether simple threshold strategies can generate positive returns net of exchange fees.",

        "Kalshi's mention markets exhibit systematic miscalibration that varies meaningfully by category. The dominant pattern is a longshot bias: low-probability contracts overestimate the likelihood of a mention, creating persistent value on the NO side. This bias survives after accounting for Kalshi's taker fee schedule, which conveniently charges less at the probability extremes where the mispricing is largest.",
        "The finding that Politicians -- the highest-volume category -- also shows the best calibration suggests that liquidity and participation depth contribute to price accuracy, consistent with the broader evidence that thin markets and weak participation undermine prediction market forecasts (Wolfers & Zitzewitz, 2004; Arrow et al., 2008) and with Bürgi, Deng, and Whelan's (2025) finding that Kalshi's pricing bias has been diminishing as the market matures and volume grows. Conversely, niche categories with fewer participants and less predictable content (Entertainment, Finance) show larger deviations from fair pricing.",
        "Whether these patterns represent genuine alpha or an artifact of in-sample measurement remains an open question. The fact that the same favorite–longshot structure appears both in our mention-market subset and in Bürgi, Deng, and Whelan's (2025) exchange-wide analysis suggests the bias is not an artifact of a single market type, though whether it survives as participation deepens remains to be seen. The calibration-over-time analysis shows that the market has been improving, with MAD declining over the sample period. Traders and researchers should monitor whether these edges persist as the market matures.",
